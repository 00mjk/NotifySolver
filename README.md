# NotifySolver

NotifySolver is a Windows program that gives you the answer to a question or problem you copy, by showing a notification with the solution. 

## Installation

* Solve math problems and equations
* Convert numbers to binary, hexadecimal, or roman numerals
* Display the local time zone when a country is copied
* Organize desktop files
* Calculate body mass index (BMI) when you copy your age, weight, and height
